# eere-eti-mapbox

Custom Mapbox map for energy.gov.


Currently the gh-pages branch http://nrel.github.io/eere-eti-mapbox/ is used to drive the the public page located at http://energy.gov/eere/maps/island-energy-snapshots-map

The data, geojson and marker content, lives in Mapbox.com and can be updated there.
